# bungeequack

_If it talks like a BungeeCord, and if it quacks like a BungeeCord, then it's gotta be BungeeCord._

This plugin adds support for BungeeCord's plugin messaging channel to [Velocity](https://www.velocitypowered.com).
This allows you to use the rich selection of server-side plugins already available for BungeeCord to make
transitioning to Velocity easier.

## FAQ
