# NOTE: This plugin is deprecated with Velocity 1.1.0's native BungeeCord plugin messaging channel support.

# BungeeQuack

_If it talks like a BungeeCord, and if it quacks like a BungeeCord, then it's gotta be BungeeCord._

BungeeQuack adds support for BungeeCord's plugin messaging channel to [Velocity](https://www.velocitypowered.com).
This allows you to use the rich selection of plugins already available for BungeeCord to make transitioning to
Velocity easier.

BungeeQuack _does not_ intend to support the BungeeCord API. We wish to encourage the growth of Velocity-native
plugins in our ecosystem.
